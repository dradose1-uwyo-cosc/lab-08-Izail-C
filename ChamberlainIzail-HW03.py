Overview

Your goal for this program is to write a program that given a date of the format MM/DD/YYYY, your program will then
state the day of the week the date occurs on.

Notes

April, June, September, November have 30 days

January, March, May, July, August, October, December have 31 days

February typically has 28 days, 29 in a leap year

Leap years occur in years equally divisible by 4, and not by 100 except in the case when they are
divisible by 400. So 2000 was a leap year, however 2100 will not be

Assume that Sunday is day 0 with Saturday being day 6

The day of the week that January 1st falls on can be determined using the following equation:

let y = year -1
Jan first falls on day x where:
day = (36 + y +(y/4) - (y/100) + (y/400))%7

This equation uses integer division rounded down

Once this is found, you can find what day of the week all other dates fall on. Your program should check for
invalid input. Make sure you are checking if it is a leap year if 2/29/XXXX is entered for example, and that
none of the other dates are going out of bounds. If the input is not valid, the dates supplied donâ€™t work, etc
alert the user to the issue.

Input

Your code should accept input from the command line. Dates in the form of MM/DD/YYYY will be inputted.

Output

Your code should output the inputted date followed by the day of the week it falls on, or that is invalid:

02/21/2022 Monday

01/01/2022 Saturday

02/29/2024 Thursday

02/29/2023 Invalid Date

04/31/2023 Invalid Date

02/00/2023 Invalid Date

Hints

Here are some suggestions, they aren't required but they will make your life easier:

Break things down into functions, such as:
Checking if it is a leap year
Calculating on what day January 1st occurs
Checking if the date entered is valid
Calculating the day of the week for the supplied date
Utilize data structures!
This helps make your code more concise
And also is easier to program
A dictionary to map months with their days
A list for days of the week
etc
// is Python's floor division
Meaning, it will divide two numbers and give you the integer result rounded down
9//2 would give 4 for example
Have a calendar open when testing this
Test edge cases
leap days in leap years and not
Days after a leap day
Going out of bounds in a month
etc
DISALLOWED

You CANNOT use external libraries to determine the day of the week something occurs on, e.g the DateTime library. Doing so will result in your program receiving a 0. You must write all the solution yourself.
